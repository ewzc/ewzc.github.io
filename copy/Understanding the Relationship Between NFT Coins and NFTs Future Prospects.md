# Understanding the Relationship Between NFT Coins and NFTs: Future Prospects  

## What Are NFTs and NFT Coins?  

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have re-emerged as a dominant trend in the blockchain space, driven by high-profile digital collectibles like NFT avatars selling for millions. While many conflate NFTs with specific cryptocurrencies like APENFT (often called "NFT coin"), it's crucial to distinguish their roles and relationships.  

### The Core Difference  
NFTs represent unique digital assets verified through blockchain technology. Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin), each NFT is irreplaceable and indivisible. For example, a digital artwork tokenized as an NFT carries verifiable ownership records on the blockchain.  

**APENFT (NFT Coin)**, however, is a cryptocurrency built on established blockchains like Ethereum and TRON. As the native token of the APENFT Foundation, it serves specific utility functions within its ecosystem, including governance rights and revenue sharing. While APENFT is an NFT-focused cryptocurrency, it operates differently from general NFTs.

## Technical Foundations of APENFT  

APENFT leverages two major blockchain infrastructures:  
1. **Ethereum**: Utilizes the ERC-20 standard for smart contract functionality  
2. **TRON**: Implements TRC-20 protocol for faster transaction speeds  

The project also integrates BitTorrent File System (BTFS) for decentralized data storage. Registered in Singapore in 2021, APENFT's mission centers on digitizing high-value artworks through NFT technology.  

### Key Features of APENFT  
- Governance rights for token holders  
- Revenue distribution mechanisms  
- Cross-chain compatibility  
- Smart contract-enabled transactions  

## NFT Market Dynamics  

### Global Speculation vs. Regulatory Caution  
International markets have witnessed explosive NFT trading, with some digital assets reaching astronomical prices. However, speculative excesses have drawn criticism. In contrast, China's approach emphasizes regulatory compliance:  

- **Restricted Secondary Markets**: Most platforms prohibit reselling NFTs  
- **Limited Utility**: Purchased NFTs often serve only display purposes  
- **Case Study**: A 9.9 yuan NFT skin briefly reached 1 million yuan on secondary markets before being delisted  

### Expert Insights  
According to industry analysts, China's NFT development prioritizes documentation of digital rights over financial speculation. The current framework focuses on:  
- Immutable ownership records  
- Transparent transaction histories  
- Compliance-first development
