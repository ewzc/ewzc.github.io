## Making Your First Trade  

With funds in your account, youâ€™re ready to execute your first trade. Navigate to the trading section, select your desired cryptocurrency, and choose between a **market order** (buy at current price) or **limit order** (set a specific price).

## Withdrawing Your Cryptocurrency  

For enhanced security, consider transferring your crypto to a personal wallet after purchase. Exchanges are vulnerable to hacking, so storing assets in a wallet gives you greater control.
