# DDC Enterprise Expands Bitcoin Treasury with Acquisition of 79 BTC and Announces Partnership with Hex Trust for Secure Custody and Trading Execution Services

## Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Strengthening Treasury Reserves

**DDC Enterprise Limited** (NYSE: DDC) has taken a decisive step in reinforcing its financial strategy by acquiring **79 Bitcoin (BTC)**. This acquisition, valued at **$7.2 million** at current market rates, represents a **400% increase** in BTC holdings per 1,000 shares‚Äîfrom 0.006122 to 0.024963 BTC. The transaction was facilitated through the issuance of **580,187 Class A ordinary shares**, aligning with DDC‚Äôs long-term vision to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity-driven value proposition. This move follows DDC‚Äôs initial purchase of **21 BTC on May 23, 2025**, bringing its total holdings to **100 BTC**.

The decision to expand Bitcoin reserves reflects DDC‚Äôs confidence in digital assets as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury portfolio, DDC aims to diversify risk while capitalizing on the asset‚Äôs potential for appreciation. This strategic shift mirrors a broader trend among corporations seeking alternative stores of value amid macroeconomic uncertainty.

### Why Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves?

Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply of **21 million coins** positions it as a deflationary asset, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that face inflationary pressures from central bank policies. For DDC, this scarcity aligns with its goal to preserve capital over the long term. Additionally, Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature reduces reliance on traditional financial systems, offering a level of autonomy that resonates with DDC‚Äôs vision for financial resilience.
