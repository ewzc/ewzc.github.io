## 5 Strategies to Make Money with Cryptocurrencies in 2025  

### 1. Invest in Crypto Presales  

**Crypto presales** allow investors to purchase tokens before they launch on public exchanges. These early-stage investments often occur at discounted prices, offering potential for significant returns if the project succeeds.  

#### How Presales Work  
Presales are typically limited to a short timeframe and structured in phases with increasing prices. Funds raised often support project development. However, investing in untested projects carries risks, as not all presales deliver on their promises.  

#### Potential Returns  
- **x1000 Gains:** Rare but possible, as seen with Shiba Inu (SHIB).  
- **x20â€“x50 Gains:** More realistic but still exceptional, often tied to market hype.  
- **x2â€“x10 Gains:** Common for projects with strong fundamentals and community support.  
- **Minimal or Negative Returns:** Projects may fail to gain traction, resulting in stagnant or declining prices.  

#### Top Presales in 2025  
- **Solana Layer 2 Solution:** Raised $28M+; improves efficiency and reduces costs.  
- **Telegram-Based Trading Platform:** Offers low fees and integrated tools like copy trading.  
- **Bitcoin Transaction Protocol:** Enables fast, low-cost Bitcoin transactions and DeFi integration.

#### Popular Staking Cryptocurrencies  
- **Ethereum (ETH):** ~4â€“7% annual yield.  
- **Lesser-Known Tokens:** Potential for 40%+ returns but higher volatility.  

#### Risks to Consider  
- **Price Volatility:** Staked tokens may lose value during market downturns.  
- **Platform Reliability:** Use trusted platforms to avoid scams or liquidity issues.  

#### Best Wallet for Staking  
**Non-custodial wallets** like OKX Wallet support staking for over 1,000 tokens across 60+ blockchains, ensuring security and flexibility.
