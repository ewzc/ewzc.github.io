Depositing funds into your cryptocurrency exchange account requires precision and attention to network compatibility. This guide explains how to securely deposit crypto using the OKX platform, covering key considerations like network selection, minimum amounts, and QR code usage.

### Step 1: Log In and Access the Deposit Section

1. **Sign in** to your OKX account via [OKX Official Website](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus).  
2. Navigate to the **Assets** section and select **Deposit**.  

This interface allows you to specify the cryptocurrency and blockchain network for your deposit.

### Step 2: Choose Your Cryptocurrency and Network  

Select your preferred **crypto asset** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and the corresponding **network** (e.g., ERC-20, TRC-20) from the drop-down menus.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Note**: Ensure the selected network matches the **withdrawal network** of the exchange/platform you're sending funds from. Mismatched networks may result in permanent loss of assets.  

| Popular Cryptocurrencies and Compatible Networks |  
|--------------------------------------------------|  
| **BTC** (Bitcoin) - Native Blockchain             |  
| **ETH** (Ethereum) - ERC-20, ERC-1155            |  
| **USDT** (Tether) - TRC-20, ERC-20, BEP-20       |  
| **XRP** (XRP) - XRP Ledger                        |  

Click **Next** to proceed.

### Step 3: Complete the Deposit  

OKX will generate a unique deposit address and QR code. Choose one of the following options:  

- **Copy Address**: Paste the address into your external wallet or exchange.  
- **Scan QR Code**: Use your wallet's QR scanner to initiate the transfer.  

üîç **Example**: If you're transferring USDT from Binance, ensure both platforms are set to **TRC-20** to avoid fees or delays.  

---

### Key Deposit Considerations  

#### 1. Minimum Deposit Amounts  
Transfers below the minimum threshold will not be credited. For example:  
- **BTC**: 0.0005 BTC  
- **ETH**: 0.005 ETH  
- **USDT**: 1 USDT  

#### 2. Transaction Confirmations  
Most networks require **1-2 confirmations** for deposits to appear. Bitcoin may take **3-6 confirmations** during high congestion.  

#### 3. Tags/Memos for Specific Cryptocurrencies  
Certain assets like **XRP** or **BNB** require a **tag/memo** (a unique string of numbers) to complete the transaction. Missing this detail will result in irreversible loss.
