- **Market Cap**: $9.81 billion  
- **24h Trading Volume**: $567 million  
- **Circulating Supply**: 19 million BCH

## Technical Analysis: BCH/USD Dynamics

### Key Price Levels to Watch
- **Resistance Zones**: $507, $511, $530  
- **Support Levels**: $454, $397, $370  

The BCH/USD pair currently hovers around $492, testing the upper boundary of the Keltner Channel â€“ a sign of healthy consolidation before a potential directional move. Historically, such patterns precede significant price shifts when volume increases.

**Resistance Scenario**: A confirmed break above $507 could accelerate bullish momentum toward $511 and $530 targets. This would validate the formation of a new uptrend cycle.

**Support Scenario**: Failure to maintain $492 could trigger corrections toward the $454 support level. Further breakdown below this zone might extend selling pressure toward $397 and $370 historical consolidation areas.

### Indicator Insights
- **MACD**: Bullish bias maintained as the MACD line remains above the signal line with positive histogram bars  
- **Keltner Channel**: Price hugging upper band suggests strong buying pressure despite short-term consolidation
