## Impact on User Experience
The new requirements will particularly affect high-volume traders and institutional investors operating in Poland and Belgium. While the â‚¬1,000 threshold for deposits allows small retail transactions to remain unaffected, businesses and professional traders must now maintain additional record-keeping practices.

The policy update reflects broader EU regulatory trends, including:
- Implementation of the **5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)**
- Adherence to the **Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) Travel Rule**
- Preparation for the upcoming **MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) Regulation**

## Strategic Compliance Measures
Binance's proactive approach positions the exchange as a leader in regulatory compliance within the EU market. This aligns with similar measures taken by other major exchanges like **Kraken** and **Coinbase**, which have also enhanced KYC/AML protocols for European users.
