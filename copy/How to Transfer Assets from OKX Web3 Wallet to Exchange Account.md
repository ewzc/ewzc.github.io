## Common Issue: Insufficient TRX Network Fees  

When attempting to send USDT-TRC20 tokens, you may encounter an error stating:  
> "Insufficient TRX balance for transaction fees"  

This occurs because TRON blockchain requires **TRX tokens** to cover network gas fees. In this example, 27.8 TRX (~$1.50 USD equivalent) is needed for the transfer.  

### Why TRX is Required  
TRX serves as the native fuel for TRON blockchain operations, similar to ETH for Ethereum-based transactions. Without sufficient TRX, your wallet cannot process blockchain interactions.

   - Open your OKX exchange account  
   - Access the trading dashboard via the [Trade] button  

2. **Acquire TRX Tokens**:  
   - Search for "TRX" in the market list  
   - Purchase ~30-40 TRX to cover current and future transactions  

3. **Transfer TRX to Web3 Wallet**:  
   - In your Web3 wallet, select [Receive] > [TRX]  
   - Copy the wallet address  
   - Return to exchange account and initiate TRX withdrawal:  
     - Network: TRON (TRC20)  
     - Address: Paste copied wallet address

## FAQ: Common Questions About Web3 Wallet Transfers  

### Why do I need TRX tokens for USDT transfers?  
USDT-TRC20 operates on the TRON blockchain, where TRX tokens are required to pay for computational resources. This mechanism prevents network spam and maintains blockchain integrity.
