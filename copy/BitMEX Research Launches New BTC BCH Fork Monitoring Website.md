# BitMEX Research Launches New BTC/BCH Fork Monitoring Website  

In a significant development for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and blockchain analysts, BitMEX Research has unveiled **ForkMonitor.info**, a dedicated platform for tracking network upgrades across Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This tool aims to provide real-time insights into both softforks and hardforks, ensuring stakeholders can monitor consensus changes and potential vulnerabilities in these blockchain ecosystems.  

## Focus on Bitcoin Cash and BTC/BCH Fork Monitoring  

While ForkMonitor.info supports both BTC and BCH networks, Bitcoin Cash currently takes center stage. The platform runs **eight BCH nodes** compared to five BTC nodes, reflecting the imminent Bitcoin Cash hardfork scheduled for November 15. This event has generated considerable anticipation, prompting BitMEX Research to prioritize BCH monitoring temporarily.  

According to BitMEX's official blog post, the team plans to rebalance node distribution post-hardfork by incorporating older versions of Bitcoin Core and independent implementations like **Bcoin, BTCD, and Libbitcoin**. This strategy will enhance the platform's ability to detect consensus bugs, such as the 2018 inflation bug **CVE-2018-17144**, which exposed critical vulnerabilities in the network.

## Bitcoin Cash Hardfork: Scenarios and Implications  

The upcoming Bitcoin Cash hardfork could result in three distinct chains:  
1. **Bitcoin ABC**: A proposed upgrade by the core BCH development team.  
2. **Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision)**: A rival chain advocating for larger block sizes.  
3. **Original Rules Chain**: A potential continuation of BCH's pre-fork protocol.  

This fragmentation highlights the importance of tools like ForkMonitor.info in tracking chain validity and miner support.  

### Market Reactions and BTC/BCH Fork Monitoring  

As is typical during hardfork events, Bitcoin Cash has experienced a price surge. Over the past seven days, BCH has risen **32.33%**, followed by a minor correction of **0.58%** in the last 24 hours. This volatility has spilled over into the broader cryptocurrency market, with most assets showing gains.

The pre-fork rally underscores how network upgrades can influence investor sentiment. ForkMonitor.info aims to provide transparency during such events, reducing uncertainty by offering real-time validation insights.  

## Open-Source Commitment and Future Roadmap  

To foster wider adoption and trust, ForkMonitor.info will release its codebase as **open-source software**. This initiative encourages other organizations to deploy similar monitoring systems, enhancing collective security across blockchain networks.  

BitMEX Research also plans to expand the platform's capabilities beyond BTC/BCH fork monitoring, potentially supporting other major cryptocurrencies. By analyzing historical consensus bugs and tracking node distribution, ForkMonitor.info could become an industry standard for blockchain transparency.
