## Regulatory Framework: Balancing Innovation and Compliance

### Licensing System for Virtual Asset Service Providers
Hong Kong's Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) has committed to implementing a **licensing regime for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)**. This system will:
- Require exchanges to comply with AML/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism) standards
- Establish investor protection protocols
- Create parity between crypto exchanges and traditional financial institutions

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will conduct public consultations to determine appropriate retail investor access levels, ensuring market integrity while enabling broader participation.

### Strategic Pillars of Regulation
| Regulatory Principle | Implementation Strategy | Expected Impact |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Technology-Neutral Framework | Applying "same business, same risk, same rules" principle | Ensures fair competition between traditional finance and crypto |
| Risk-Based Approach | Tailoring requirements to business models | Prevents regulatory overreach while maintaining safeguards |
| International Alignment | Monitoring global regulatory developments | Facilitates cross-border operations and compliance |
